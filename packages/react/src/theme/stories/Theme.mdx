# Theme

A theme component allows you to manage various objects that define your application's colors, spacing, fonts, and more in a coherent and organized manner. 

By centralizing these design elements within a theme component, you can ensure consistency and ease of maintenance throughout your application. 

This approach enables you to easily update and modify the visual aspects of your application by making changes within the theme component, 
leading to a more streamlined and efficient design process.
