/**
 * A hook to create a callback function that remains referentially stable
 * across renders but always executes the most recent implementation of
 * the provided function.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This hook should be used sparingly as it bypasses React's reactivity model.
 * When the inputs to the callback change, the returned function remains the same,
 * potentially causing issues where components or hooks depending on reactivity
 * might not update as expected.
 *
 * Additionally, avoid calling the returned function during the render phase
 * as the values it captures may not reflect the most up-to-date state.
 *
 * @typeParam T - The type of the function being passed.
 *
 * @param fn - The function whose stable reference is required.
 * @returns A stable callback function that always executes the latest version of `fn`.
